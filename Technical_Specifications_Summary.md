# Technical Specifications Summary for Sierpinski Matrix Ledger Protocol (SMLP)

## Overview
The Sierpinski Matrix Ledger Protocol (SMLP) is a fractal-based decentralized ledger system leveraging fractal geometry principles to create a scalable, self-similar recursive ledger structure. It introduces novel mechanisms for mining, consensus, economic modeling, smart contracts, oracle integration, and governance.
