# Sierpinski Matrix Ledger Protocol (SMLP)

## Project Overview
The Sierpinski Matrix Ledger Protocol (SMLP) introduces a novel cryptocurrency ecosystem that self-organizes using the principles of fractal geometry. By evolving in a non-linear fashion, SMLP forms a living mathematical organism that creates value through recursive geometric patterns, leveraging a unique architecture beyond traditional blockchain technology.

## Installation

### Prerequisites
- Node.js (version >= 14.15.0)
- npm (Node package manager)

### Steps
1. Clone this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/Sierpinski-Matrix-Ledger-Protocol.git
   cd Sierpinski-Matrix-Ledger-Protocol
   ```

2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. If you want to run tests:
   ```bash
   npm install --save-dev
   ```

## Usage
To use the SMLP framework, you can run the provided scripts or create your own scripts based on the APIs designed for working with the SMLP. For example, you can run the application using:
```bash
npm start
```

## Features
- **Fractal Mining Mechanics:** Uses geometric proof workflows to create exponentially complex structures.
- **Dynamic Scarcity Engine:** Implements level-based token scarcity.
- **Revolutionary Consensus Algorithm:** Drives the network through Proof of Fractal Harmony (PoFH).
- **Advanced Economic Mechanisms:** Includes a Triple Burn Protocol and Ancestral Dividend System.
- **Network Governance:** Features a democratic model via the Sierpinski Senate.
- **Self-Organizing Economy:** Leverages fractal principles for economic interactions.
