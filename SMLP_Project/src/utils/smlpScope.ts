export const smlpScopeAndObjectives = `
The Sierpinski Matrix Ledger Protocol (SMLP) ecosystem aims to revolutionize cryptocurrency architecture by leveraging fractal geometry principles.
Scope:
- Develop a self-organizing fractal cryptocurrency ecosystem with scalable ledger structures.
- Implement fractal mining protocols and proof mechanisms based on geometric properties.
- Design advanced economic mechanisms including tokenomics, scarcity, and dividend systems.
- Establish a democratic fractal governance model for network consensus and decision-making.
- Integrate real-world oracle data feeds and smart contract functionality.
Objectives:
- Create a fully functional fractal ledger with real-time state tracking.
- Ensure network security through mathematical proofs and fractal consensus algorithms.
- Achieve efficient communication and data storage using fractal subdivisions.
- Launch the Genesis Event with initial token distribution and network activation.
- Document and expand the ecosystem with future-proof technical specifications and roadmap.
